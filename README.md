## üìä A few interesting AI/ML projects:
Over the years I have worked on many projects (150+). I have included a few relevant ones here, but feel 
free to browse the repositories if you are interested in the details. For each file I wrote a 
dedicated README file, but if you have any questions or suggestions don't hesitate to reach out.

### ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning
Implemented several reinforcement learning architectures, achieving a total score improvement of **~400%** in DQN Cartpole v1 compared to the benchmark model established in Q-learning Agent for CartPole.
- [Q-learning Agent for CartPole](https://github.com/mennosmit-dev/AI-Engineer-Certificate/blob/main/03_Deep_Learning_with_Keras_and_TensorFlow/q_learning_agent_cartpole.py)  
- [DQN CartPole v1](https://github.com/mennosmit-dev/AI-Engineer-Certificate/blob/main/03_Deep_Learning_with_Keras_and_TensorFlow/dqn_cartpolev1.py)
- (For anyone interested in PPO, I found this interesting) [RL insight paper](https://github.com/mennosmit-dev/AI-Engineer-Certificate/blob/main/11_Generative_AI_Advance_Fine-Tuning_for_LLMs/REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING.pdf).

### üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision
- Aviation damage detection (MSE: 25.89)  
- Caption generation from image features  
- CNNs for MNIST ‚Üí boosted accuracy from 99.5% to **99.7%**  
- Autoencoder vs. Diffusion models for denoising ‚Üí reduced cross-entropy from **0.204** to **0.0996**  
- VGG16 transfer learning for waste and fruit classification

### üß† AI Agents & Transformers
- Designed modular agents for strategic environments  
- Worked with LLMs and transformer-based pipelines

### Robotics 
...

### üìà Machine Learning
- Egalitarian Lasso for group forecasting  
- Income prediction using Random Forest  
- Custom batch gradient descent for parameter optimization

#### üè† Utilising CNN and CV to forest housing prices 
- Led an in-depth academic discussion on a paper that utilised web scraping of images and text from
house rental websites and utilised NLP and CV to extract features from them, which were used in a
random forest approach to predict housing prices in Rotterdam [(Discussion_Paper)](https://github.com/mennosmit-dev/Econometric_Modelling/blob/main/discussion_paper.pdf).
