# 👋 Hi, I'm Menno Smit

Applied Machine Learning Engineer with a strong data science and quantitative modeling background.  
MSc Econometrics | Reinforcement Learning | MLOps  

I build end-to-end ML systems, from modeling and experimentation to automated pipelines and deployment.

## 🚀 Flagship Project

### Production-Grade Reinforcement Learning Portfolio System

Reinforcement learning framework for long-horizon ETF allocation (based on my MSc thesis), currently being deployed as a fully automated pipeline.

• Weekly automated ETL & feature engineering  
• Portfolio prediction & dynamic position sizing  
• Performance & risk monitoring  
• Bi-annual retraining to address concept drift  
• API-integrated execution & tracking  

Tech: PyTorch, Docker, MLflow, time-series modeling, automated workflows
