## üìä A few interesting AI/ML projects:
Over the years I have worked on many projects (200+). I have included a few relevant ones here, but feel 
free to browse the repositories if you are interested in the details. For each file I wrote a 
dedicated README file, but if you have any questions or suggestions don't hesitate to reach out.
